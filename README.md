Exercise repo with some sticky gituations

Companion blog post: https://medium.com/@valgaze


**Gituation, (noun):** A situation, oftentimes unpleasant or confusing, involving git commit histories

This repo contains three branches, each with a different troublesome gituation. If you reach an unrecoverable state, you can reset the repo's branches by running ```npm run rebuild```


Branches & clues:

| Branch  |  Issue + clue |
|---|:-:|
| ex/1  | Typo in first commit (amend the message)  |
| ex/2  | Too many commits (squash the commits together)  |
| ex/3  | Most recent commit broke something (revert back)  |
